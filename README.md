# Alex Hill — Analytical Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio site.  

This page showcases applied examples of my work in financial analysis, data analysis, and business problem-solving.

Rather than listing skills, I present complete, documented projects that demonstrate how I:

- Structure analytical problems  
- Clean and prepare real-world datasets  
- Apply statistical and financial modeling techniques  
- Communicate findings clearly  

Each project links to its full GitHub repository for detailed review.
