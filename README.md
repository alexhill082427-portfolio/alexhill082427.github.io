# Alex Hill — Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, hosted via GitHub Pages.

The site serves as a centralized location for:
  
- Python data analysis projects  
- Academic research writing
- Excel-based projects

**Live Site:**  
https://alexhill082427.github.io

## Purpose
This website is designed to provide clear demonstrations of my analytical and technical work.

Rather than simply listing skills, the site showcases complete, documented examples of how I approach problems, structure analysis, and communicate results.  
Each project links to its full GitHub repository for detailed review.

## Updating the Site

Changes are made directly in the Markdown files and deployed automatically through GitHub Pages when committed to the `main` branch.
